# Book-It App

## Neth Horn and Richard Jimenez

## Version 1.2.3

This is an app that displays book data. It is a tribute to the Book-It program of our youths. We may not be able to give you a free personal pan pizza, but we can deliver hot and fresh book data.

### How to Run
Make sure to install the npm dependancies, add your postgres database information to the server.js file and run the server.

## What it's made of
This is an application made with nodejs, Expressjs, the EJS templating engine, with a Postgresql database.

We would like to thank the good folks at Heroku who let people like us run apps for free.
Also npm because it's great.
Also the BBC for making the Great British Baking Programme which has nothing to do with this app but is a fantastic show.
